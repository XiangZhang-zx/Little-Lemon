# Little Lemon Restaurant Reservation System

This project is a restaurant reservation system for Little Lemon, built with React and TypeScript.

## Book a Table Feature

The "Book a Table" feature allows customers to reserve a table at Little Lemon restaurant. It provides a user-friendly interface where customers can select a date, time, and specify the number of guests. The system ensures that only available times are shown to prevent double bookings.

### Key Features:
- **Date and Time Selection**: Customers can choose their preferred date and time for the reservation.
- **Guest Count**: Allows specifying the number of guests, with a limit to ensure comfort and safety.
- **Real-time Availability**: The system fetches available times from an API to ensure up-to-date information.
- **Confirmation**: Upon successful reservation, customers receive a confirmation message.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
